# Change: Add Colombia Tax Reporting

## Why
Colombia reporting needs COP-native income and expense summaries across all Colombia transactions.

## What Changes
- Add Colombia income and expense summaries in COP (not limited to rental).
- Use the existing category-to-form mapping rules already shared across jurisdictions.
- Show Colombia reporting totals only in COP in the UI.

## Impact
- Affected specs: colombia-tax-reporting
- Affected code: Colombia tax summaries, reporting UI
