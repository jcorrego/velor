# Change: Add US Form 1040-NR Reporting

## Why
US nonresident filers need a 1040-NR summary that mirrors how existing US tax forms are summarized in the app.

## What Changes
- Add 1040-NR summary reporting using category tax mappings and USD normalization.
- Add a 1040-NR reporting UI that follows the same filing-selection pattern as Schedule E and Form 5472.

## Impact
- Affected specs: us-tax-reporting
- Affected code: US tax reporting service, UI pages, routes, tests
