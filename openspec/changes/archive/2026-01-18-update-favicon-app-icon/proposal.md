# Change: Update favicon to use the app icon

## Why
The browser tab should reflect the product brand by using the same icon as the application for a consistent visual identity.

## What Changes
- Use the app icon asset as the favicon across the web UI.
- Ensure favicon references are updated in the base layout and related metadata.
- Favicon line color should be the primary brand color

## Impact
- Affected specs: ui-branding (new)
- Affected code: base Blade layout(s), public favicon assets
