# Change: Move Finance sections to sidebar navigation

## Why
The Finance page uses tabs for core sections, which hides these destinations from the global navigation and makes them less discoverable. Moving them into the left sidebar aligns them with existing form links and improves consistency.

## What Changes
- Add sidebar links for Finance sections: Accounts, Transactions, Assets, Categories, and Mappings.
- Remove the tab-based navigation within the Finance page for these sections.
- Keep existing form links in the sidebar and place the Finance section links alongside them.
- Remove the Finance page, not the "Group", and related files and code.

## Impact
- Affected specs: finance-management
- Affected code: Finance UI navigation (sidebar/menu), Finance page layout/templates, related navigation tests
